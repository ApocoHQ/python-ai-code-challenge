# üêç ü§ñ Python AI Code Challenge

This repository contains a coding exercise for new developers joining the AI/python development team.

Fork this repository and create your own exercise!

## üìú What we want you to build

You will be building an autonomous AI agent that can reason over [Generative AI Python SDK](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-generative-ai) documentation.
The application (chatbot) should be able to answer questions on the documentation topics; as a bonus, your application can even code and browse the web!

**Technology Stack**:
- Python,
- LLM,
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/),
- [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) or any other Vector Store.

### üéØ Objectives

- Create an application that allows the user to query our SDK documentation.
  - The agent remembers conversation context.
  - The agent handles large conversations.
  - Every response related to the SDK documentation must contain sources (relevant links to the documentation page).
- Introduce UI for communication with the agent ([Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) / [React](https://react.dev/) whatever you want!)
  - Handle edge cases and crashes.
  - (optional) Use streaming for responses.
  - (optional) Allow the user to upload file(s). 
- (optional) The agent can lookup for specific facts on the web (Google / DuckDuckGo).
- (optional) The agent can execute Python code.
- (optional) The agent can work with files (CSV / PDF).
- (optional) One can interact with the agent via CLI.
- (optional) One can interact with the agent via API (Rest/gRPC).

### üîó Links

- GenAI Python SDK (https://github.com/IBM/ibm-generative-ai) with HTML documentation (https://ibm.github.io/ibm-generative-ai/).
- (optional) GenAI Node.js SDK (https://github.com/IBM/ibm-generative-ai-node-sdk).

### üìù Notes
- Be creative. Everything extra/custom is appreciated ü¶Ñ
- You can use more technologies, but those mentioned are required.
- Explain your decisions and choices. We want to see you know what you are doing.
- Document your code, mainly the parts related to LLM (parameters, sizes, etc.).
- Describe how the final application works in general.

Feel free to ask us if you have any doubt or you face any problem!
